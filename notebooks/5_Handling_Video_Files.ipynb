    "Sometimes it is necessary to read a sequence of images from a standard video file, such as `.avi` and `.mov` files.\n",
    "In a scientific context, it is usually better to avoid these formats in favor of a simple directory of images or a multi-dimensional TIF. Video formats are more difficult to read piecemeal, typically do not support random frame access or research-minded meta data, and use lossy compression if not carefully configured. But video files are in widespread use, and they are easy to share, so it is convenient to be equipped to read and write them when necessary.\n",

Then the image files can be read into an **ImageCollection** by `skimage.io.imread_collection`. Converting the videos to frames can be dome easily in **ImageJ**, a cross-platform, GUI-based program from the bio-imaging community, or **FFmpeg**, a powerful command-line utility for manipulating video files. \n",

For a more direct solution, we need to execute FFmpeg or LibAV from Python to read frames from the video. FFmpeg and LibAV are two large open-source projects that decode video from the sprawling variety of formats used in the wild. There are several ways to use them from Python. Each, unfortunately, has some disadvantages."
